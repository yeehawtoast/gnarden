# Introduction

gnarden is supposed to be an open-source garden planner similar to the Old Farmer's Alminac's garden planner. However, it's a fairly simple tool that they make people pay for and I want to make one that is just as good and free for everyone. Everyone should be able to have ease in making their gardens.


## Part 1: Get something up and running

Set up a simple app that doesn't have anything
Create list of plants and planter objects
Set up Structure of app including menus, sidebars, and the editing window for placing objects
design images for plants
make plant and objects show up on sidebars
make items placable on the grid
make file saveable

## Part 2: Increase functionality
add more objects
create settings options for zone and location
start adding information about the plants you add
create an encyclopedia for the plants you add
create planting schedule that is zone-agnostic
release first alpha build
